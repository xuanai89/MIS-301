# Global AI Job Market Analysis

The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive snapshot of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) job market by analyzing a dataset of over 15,000 job postings. The analysis aims to uncover actionable insights for both companies seeking to hire talent and professionals looking to advance their careers in the AI field.

### Key Questions & Analytical Objectives:

The analysis was structured to answer five critical business questions:

1. **Core Technical Skills:** What are the top 10 most consistently demanded technical skills in the AI job market?

2. **Remote Work Trends:** What is the prevalence of on-site, hybrid, and fully remote work, and how does it impact salary?

3. **Industry Hotspots:** Which industries are the most active in hiring AI talent?

4. **Elite Employers:** Who are the most attractive employers when considering a holistic package of salary, benefits, and flexibility?

5. **Salary Drivers:** How do years of experience and education level quantitatively impact earning potential?

### Methodology

The project followed a structured data analysis workflow, executed in Python:

1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation:** Standardized column names, removed duplicate entries, converted data types (e.g., dates and currencies), and handled missing values using various strategies (dropping rows, filling with "Unknown", mode, or median).

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Visualization:** Used Python libraries to analyze the cleaned data and create visualizations (bar charts, pie charts, treemaps, line charts, and box plots) to answer the key analytical objectives.

## Key Concepts & Technologies

This project applies foundational concepts from the MIS 301 curriculum, emphasizing Python's role in business data analysis.

**Programming Language:** Python

**Core Data Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

**Development Environments:** The principles taught are applicable in IDEs such as Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, and VS Code.
